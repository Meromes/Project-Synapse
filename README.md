# BCI-VR
Welcome to Project Synapse's repository for our Brain Computer Interface (BCI). We aim to translate the user's thoughts into control signals that can be used to manipulate virtual reality. Through the usage of a BCI headset that uses electrodes to detect the electrical signals that are sent by the brain, we are attempting to process these signals and turn them into something simple like the press of a button on a controller in a game. Currently we are using a VR headset to test this concept, as VR is one of the newest gaming crazes that prides itself on tracking real-time motion and inputs. We would like to see if we can change the inputs to come from brain activity rather than handheld controllers to create a more immersive gameplay that less straining than it currently is.
